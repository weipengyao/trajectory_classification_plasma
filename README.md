# Automatic Particle Trajectory Classification

This is the dataset (4 CSV files with electron trajectory) and Matlab script for performing automatic particle trajectory.

- We had a M1 student (Dominik T. KÃœHN) doing his internship at LERMA with Andrea Ciardi, who adapted this algorithm in Python and extended it a bit, i.e., adding an Energy criteria as the clustering condition. The thesis can be found [here](https://share.obspm.fr/s/Kr8Gqx9SAEm8SzS).

- We plan to use this algorithm on our particle data from GORGON-PIC, to help us analysis the acceleration mechanisms in a turbulent plasma, and benchmark our results with the experimental data we had in the ELFIE laser facility.
